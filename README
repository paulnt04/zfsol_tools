# ZFS on Linux Tools

A set of command line tools to help manage ZFS on Linux without having to know zpool commands.

-zpool_create.sh
This tool helps create a zpool (with ability to add L2ARC and mirrored ZIL drives).

Usage:
$ sh zpool_create.sh

TODO:

Unify all tools into a single command that can call each other via arguments (eg: zfsol create rather than ./zpool_create.sh)
Add Management Tools (Modify, Replace, Add, Destroy)
